# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition
This project aims to establish a comparison between different models such as KNN, Decision Tree, SVM, ANN, and CNN for Handwritten Digits Recognition. The objective is to identify the most effective model for recognizing handwritten digits. To achieve this, each model has been implemented, and their accuracy in recognizing digits has been compared.

As part of this project, the code for each model has been included and can be reviewed and analyzed to gain a deeper understanding of their respective approaches to the task of recognizing handwritten digits. The code has been thoroughly tested and verified for reliability and accuracy.

Overall, valuable insights into the different methods and models that can be used for recognizing handwritten digits can be gained from this project. The code of the project should be checked to see how each model performs.
