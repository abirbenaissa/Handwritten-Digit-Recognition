# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition
This project aims to establish a comparison between different models such as KNN, Decision Tree, SVM, ANN, and CNN for Handwritten Digits Recognition. The objective is to identify the most effective model for recognizing handwritten digits. To achieve this, each model has been implemented, and their accuracy in recognizing digits has been compared.
